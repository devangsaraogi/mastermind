# MasterMind - The Classic Board Game
The objective of __MASTERMIND__ is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs. You can play either as a CodeBraker or a CodeMaker but in this rendition of the game, you can only play as the CodeBraker. 

## The Game
- There are 6 colours which form a 4 colour sequence - __Red__, __Blue__, __Purple__, __White__, __Green__, and __Yellow__.
- You have 10 attempts to unravel the sequence.
- For each attempt, enter your chosen color sequence and verify.
- Remember, you must enter a sequence before attempting to decode.
- If you're unable to crack the code within 10 attempts, the sequence will be unveiled, and you'll be defeated.
- Crack the code in 10 attempts or less, and you'll achieve victory.

### Decoding Feedback
- Star (*): Correct color in the correct position.
- Cross (x): Correct color in the wrong position.
- Zero (0): No correct colors.

### Giving Up?
You can reveal the sequence if you're ready to concede the challenge.
