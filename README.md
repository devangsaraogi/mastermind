# MasterMind - The Classic Board Game
The object of MASTERMIND is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 colored pegs. You can play either as a CodeBraker or a CodeMaker but in this rendition of the game, you can only play as the CodeBraker. 

## The Game

- The objective is to crack the sequence of colours set randomly by the game
- There are 6 colors which could be a part of the sequence Red, Blue, Purple, White, Green and Yellow
- There is a feedback box, which helps the user guess the sequence of colours

## The Rules

- The user is given 10 attempts to decode the sequence
  - Every attempt the player needs to enter the sequence and check if they have entered the right sequence
  - The player is not allowed to decode their sequence without first entering the sequence
  - If the user fails to guess the sequence in 10 attempts, they lose and the sequence is revealed
  - If the user cracks the code within 10 attempts, they win the game.
-Feedback Box
  - A star (*) - denotes a correct colour in the correct postion
  - A cross (x) - denotes a correct colour in the wrong position
  - A zero (0) - denotes no correct colours
- If the player wants to give up, they can reveal the sequence
